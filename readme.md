# UVa Online Judge Submissions
These are my solutions to problems listed on the [UVa Online Judge](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/) site. I don't intend these to be perfect solutions, just the ones I came up with at the time. I'll be writing about each problem in more detail on [my site](https://blog.splunk.net). The current plan is to write all the solution in ANSI-C since I'm pretty comfortable with that language. If I get real ambitious I might try out some other languages like Go or Python just to see how the different languages fix or cause different issues with the solutions.
